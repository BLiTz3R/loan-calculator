# loan-calculator v1.0
A simple JS loan calculator.

Googled the formulas for the calculations, used setTimeout() for a better user experience. 

User enters the loan amount, interest and amount of years for repayment, and it calculates the monthly payment, total payment and interest amount, with a nice, simple GUI.

v0.1: just GUI.

v0.2: Calculations, results + error message, that disappears after 3 secs, on wrong input.

v0.3: Better user experience, added "loading" icon on "calculate", results are hidden until calculated.

v1.0: Bugs fixed. Can now input any positive value.
